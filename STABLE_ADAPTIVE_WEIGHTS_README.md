# Stable Adaptive Loss Weights System

## Quick Start

```python
from myxtts.training.losses import XTTSLoss

# Create loss with stable adaptive weights (recommended)
loss_fn = XTTSLoss(
    mel_loss_weight=2.5,
    use_adaptive_weights=True  # Enable the new stable system
)

# Use in training loop
for step in range(1000):
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    # That's it! Adaptive weights work automatically and safely
```

## Problem Solved

### The Issue
The previous adaptive loss weights system had critical flaws:
- **Destructive feedback loop**: Decreasing loss → increasing weight → unstable training
- **Excessive changes**: Weight could change by ±20-30% in a single step
- **No safety checks**: NaN/Inf values were not detected
- **No gradient awareness**: Ignored gradient magnitudes
- **Result**: NaN losses after just a few epochs 💥

### The Solution
A complete refactoring with:
- **Conservative adaptation**: Maximum ±5% change per adjustment
- **Multi-metric monitoring**: Considers loss, variance, and gradients
- **Safety mechanisms**: NaN/Inf detection, validation, rollback
- **Intelligent logic**: Gradient-aware decision making
- **Cooling periods**: Minimum 50 steps between adjustments
- **Result**: No NaN losses even after hundreds of epochs ✅

## Key Features

### 1. Conservative Adaptation
```python
# Old: Could change by ±30%
old_weight = 2.5
new_weight = 3.25  # +30% in one step! Too aggressive!

# New: Maximum ±5%
current_weight = 2.5
new_weight = 2.625  # +5% maximum, gradual and safe
```

### 2. Safety Mechanisms
```python
# Automatic NaN/Inf detection
if not tf.math.is_finite(loss):
    loss = fallback_value  # Safe fallback
    tf.print("⚠️ NaN detected and replaced")

# Weight validation before applying
if self._validate_new_weight(new_weight, current_loss):
    self.current_mel_weight.assign(new_weight)
else:
    # Keep previous weight (rollback)
    tf.print("⚠️ Weight change rejected - would cause instability")
```

### 3. Intelligent Decision Making
```python
# Decision tree:
if loss_high and gradients_stable:
    # Increase weight slightly to focus more on mel loss
    direction = +1
elif loss_low or gradients_growing:
    # Decrease weight to prevent instability
    direction = -1
else:
    # No change, maintain stability
    direction = 0
```

### 4. Multi-Metric Monitoring
```python
# Get comprehensive metrics
stability = loss_fn.get_stability_metrics()
print(f"Loss variance: {stability['loss_variance']:.4f}")
print(f"Stability score: {stability['loss_stability_score']:.4f}")

adaptive = loss_fn.get_adaptive_weight_metrics()
print(f"Current weight: {adaptive['current_mel_weight']:.4f}")
print(f"Steps since last change: {adaptive['steps_since_weight_change']}")
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
```python
loss_fn = XTTSLoss(
    mel_loss_weight=2.5,                # Base weight
    use_adaptive_weights=True,           # Enable adaptation
    loss_smoothing_factor=0.1,           # Smoothing factor
    max_loss_spike_threshold=2.0,        # Spike detection
    gradient_norm_threshold=5.0          # Gradient monitoring
)
```

### Advanced Configuration (in config.py)
```python
# New parameters for fine-tuning
adaptive_weight_max_change_percent: float = 0.05    # Max 5% change
adaptive_weight_cooling_period: int = 50            # Steps between changes
adaptive_weight_min_stable_steps: int = 10          # Stability requirement
adaptive_weight_min_warmup_steps: int = 100         # Warmup before adapting
adaptive_weight_variance_threshold: float = 0.5     # Max variance for stable
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Training Loop
```python
from myxtts.training.losses import XTTSLoss
import tensorflow as tf

loss_fn = XTTSLoss(use_adaptive_weights=True)

for epoch in range(100):
    for batch in dataset:
        y_true, y_pred = batch
        
        # Compute loss (adaptive weights applied automatically)
        loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        # Train model
        optimizer.minimize(loss, model.trainable_variables)
```

### Example 2: With Monitoring
```python
loss_fn = XTTSLoss(use_adaptive_weights=True)

for step in range(1000):
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Monitor every 100 steps
    if step % 100 == 0:
        metrics = loss_fn.get_adaptive_weight_metrics()
        print(f"Step {step}:")
        print(f"  Loss: {loss:.4f}")
        print(f"  Weight: {metrics['current_mel_weight']:.4f}")
        print(f"  Since last change: {metrics['steps_since_weight_change']}")
```

### Example 3: With Gradient Monitoring
```python
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
gradient_norm = tf.linalg.global_norm(gradients)

# System can use gradient norm for smarter decisions
# (automatically if provided during weight calculation)
```

### Example 4: Manual Control
```python
loss_fn = XTTSLoss(use_adaptive_weights=True)

try:
    for step in range(1000):
        loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)
        
        # If training becomes unstable
        if detect_instability(loss):
            # Disable adaptive weights temporarily
            loss_fn.disable_adaptive_weights()
            print("⚠️ Adaptive weights disabled due to instability")
            
        # Once stable again
        if training_stable(loss):
            # Re-enable
            loss_fn.enable_adaptive_weights()
            print("✓ Adaptive weights re-enabled")
            
except Exception as e:
    # Emergency disable
    loss_fn.disable_adaptive_weights()
    print(f"Emergency: {e}")
```

## How It Works

### Adaptation Algorithm

```
For each training step:
    1. Safety Check
       └─> Check for NaN/Inf in loss
       
    2. Update Statistics
       └─> Update running average (safely)
       └─> Update gradient history (if available)
       
    3. Check Safety Conditions
       ├─> Are we past warmup period? (100 steps)
       ├─> Has cooling period elapsed? (50 steps)
       ├─> Is loss variance acceptable? (<0.5)
       └─> All must be YES to proceed
       
    4. Calculate Metrics
       ├─> loss_ratio = current / running_average
       ├─> loss_variance = variance of recent losses
       └─> gradient_growing = gradients increasing?
       
    5. Make Decision
       ├─> If loss_high AND gradients_stable:
       │   └─> Increase weight by 5%
       ├─> Elif loss_low OR gradients_growing:
       │   └─> Decrease weight by 5%
       └─> Else:
           └─> No change
           
    6. Validate & Apply
       ├─> Validate new weight
       ├─> If valid: Apply and log
       └─> If invalid: Keep previous weight
       
    7. Return Weight
       └─> Final safety clip to [1.0, 5.0]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Weights Not Changing

**Possible causes:**
- In warmup period (first 100 steps)
- Loss variance too high (>0.5)
- In cooling period (50 steps since last change)

**Solution:**
```python
metrics = loss_fn.get_adaptive_weight_metrics()
print(f"Steps: {loss_fn.step_count.numpy()}")
print(f"Stable steps: {metrics['consecutive_stable_steps']}")
print(f"Since last change: {metrics['steps_since_weight_change']}")

stability = loss_fn.get_stability_metrics()
print(f"Variance: {stability['loss_variance']:.4f}")
```

### Issue: Training Unstable

**Solution:**
```python
# Temporarily disable adaptive weights
loss_fn.disable_adaptive_weights()

# Check other factors:
# - Learning rate might be too high
# - Batch size might be too small
# - Data might be corrupted

# Once stable, re-enable
loss_fn.enable_adaptive_weights()
```

### Issue: NaN Still Occurring

**This should be extremely rare with the new system.**

If it happens:
```python
# 1. Check model architecture for numerical issues
# 2. Reduce learning rate significantly
# 3. Enable gradient clipping
# 4. Check data for corrupted samples
# 5. Disable adaptive weights if needed
loss_fn.disable_adaptive_weights()
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

**Good news: No changes required!**

The new system is **backward compatible**. Your existing code will automatically use the new stable implementation:

```python
# This code works the same, but with better stability
loss_fn = XTTSLoss(use_adaptive_weights=True)
```

### To Use New Features

```python
# Add gradient monitoring (optional)
gradient_norm = tf.linalg.global_norm(gradients)
# System automatically uses it if available

# Access new metrics
adaptive_metrics = loss_fn.get_adaptive_weight_metrics()

# Manual control (new capability)
loss_fn.disable_adaptive_weights()
loss_fn.enable_adaptive_weights()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always enable adaptive weights**
   - The system is conservative and safe
   - Benefits outweigh any risks

2. **Monitor metrics regularly**
   - Check every 100-1000 steps
   - Watch for unusual patterns

3. **Use gradient monitoring when possible**
   - Provides better decisions
   - Simple to add

4. **Keep default parameters**
   - Already tuned for stability
   - Only adjust if you understand implications

5. **Log weight changes**
   - Helps understand training dynamics
   - Useful for debugging
