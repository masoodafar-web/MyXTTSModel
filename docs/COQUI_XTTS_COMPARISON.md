## Training Pipeline Comparison

### Loss Functions

|----------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Mel Spectrogram Loss | L1 Loss | L1 or Huber Loss | Enhanced stability |
| Stop Token Loss | Binary Cross-Entropy | BCE with class balancing | Better convergence |
| KL Divergence | Standard KL | Standard KL with adaptive weighting | Improved balance |
| Duration Loss | Optional | Optional with predictor | Enhanced alignment |
| Attention Loss | Optional | Optional monotonic alignment | Training stability |

#### Mel Spectrogram Loss

**Coqui XTTS:**
```python
# Standard L1 loss
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(target - predicted))
```

**MyXTTS:**
```python
# Enhanced with Huber loss option and label smoothing
if use_huber_loss:
    # Huber loss - less sensitive to outliers
    diff = target - predicted
    is_small_error = tf.abs(diff) <= delta
    loss = tf.where(is_small_error, 
                   tf.square(diff) / 2.0,
                   delta * tf.abs(diff) - tf.square(delta) / 2.0)
else:
    # Standard L1 loss
    loss = tf.abs(target - predicted)
```

**Benefits:**
- More robust to outliers during early training
- Better gradient flow in later stages
- Optional label smoothing for regularization

#### Stop Token Loss

**Coqui XTTS:**
```python
# Standard binary cross-entropy
loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(target, predicted)
```

**MyXTTS:**
```python
# Class-balanced BCE with positive weight
pos_loss = -target * tf.math.log(predicted + eps) * positive_weight
neg_loss = -(1 - target) * tf.math.log(1 - predicted + eps)
loss = pos_loss + neg_loss
```

**Benefits:**
- Addresses class imbalance (most tokens are non-stop)
- Faster convergence for stop token prediction
- Better EOS detection during inference

### Optimizer Configuration

| Setting | Coqui XTTS | MyXTTS | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| Optimizer | Adam/AdamW | AdamW | Same |
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 | 8e-5 to 1e-4 | MyXTTS more conservative by default |
| Beta1 | 0.9 | 0.9 | Same |
| Beta2 | 0.999 | 0.999 | Same |
| Weight Decay | 0.01 | 0.01 | Same |
| Gradient Clipping | 1.0 | 0.8-1.0 | MyXTTS more aggressive |
| Warmup Steps | 4000 | 1500-4000 | MyXTTS configurable |
| LR Schedule | Cosine | Cosine with restarts | MyXTTS enhanced |

**MyXTTS Enhancements:**
- Configurable learning rate with automatic tuning
- Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- Automatic reduction on plateau
- Gradient accumulation support

### Training Stability Features

#### Loss Smoothing

**MyXTTS introduces loss smoothing to reduce training instability:**

```python
# Exponential moving average of loss
smoothed_loss = α * current_loss + (1 - α) * previous_loss
```

This helps with:
- Reducing loss oscillations
- More stable gradient updates
- Better convergence in later stages

**Coqui XTTS:** No built-in loss smoothing

#### Adaptive Loss Weights

**MyXTTS automatically adjusts loss weights during training:**

```python
# Adaptive weighting based on loss magnitudes
mel_weight = base_weight * (1 + mel_loss_ema / total_loss_ema)
```

This ensures:
- Balanced training across loss components
- Prevents one loss from dominating
- Better convergence properties

**Coqui XTTS:** Fixed loss weights
