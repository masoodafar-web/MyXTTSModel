## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Training won't start:**
- Check GPU availability and memory
- Verify dataset paths exist
- Ensure sufficient disk space for checkpoints

**Out of Memory (OOM) errors:**
- The notebook automatically adjusts batch size
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` manually if needed
- Enable more aggressive memory optimization

**Training interrupted:**
- Simply re-run the training cell - it will resume automatically
- Check `./checkpoints/` for available recovery points

**Poor synthesis quality:**
- Review validation metrics in inference cell
- Check training loss convergence
- Validate dataset quality

## Advanced Configuration

### Memory-Constrained Systems
```python
# The notebook automatically optimizes for available GPU memory
# Additional manual adjustments can be made in Cell 4
BATCH_SIZE = 1  # Minimum for very low memory
GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 32  # Maintain effective batch size
```

### High-Performance Systems
```python
# For systems with abundant GPU memory
BATCH_SIZE = 8  # Increase for faster training
GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 4  # Reduce accumulation
```

## Support and Documentation

- **Full documentation**: Available in each notebook cell
- **Production monitoring**: Real-time status in training outputs
- **Error messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Recovery procedures**: Automatic with manual fallback options
